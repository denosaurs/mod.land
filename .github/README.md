Taking inspiration from the great [js.org][js-org] project we at @denosaurs
thought of giving something back to the deno community: a free and sleek URL
where you can host a free website for your deno project.

## How to get one?

Pretty simple.

### Step 1 - Create and statically host a website

Find a static site hosting service (we recommend [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]) and
create your site. If you need some inspiration, this site is built and hosted
with GitHub Pages and deployed with GitHub Actions.

### Step 2 - Choose your subdomain

Now you should determine your mod.land subdomain: either choose your username or
the name of your repository, according to the existing GitHub Pages URL (for
http://foo.github.io/bar, either "foo.mod.land" or "bar.mod.land" would be
possible).

### Step 3 - Add a CNAME to your repo

Add a file named "CNAME" to your root directory of your repository (or in the
"gh-pages" branch, if you use that) with a single line matching the domain you
have chosen (e.g. "foo.mod.land" without quotes). For more info about this step
you can follow the [Custom URLs](gh-custom-urls) section at GitHub Pages Help.

```diff
+ foo.mod.land
```

### Step 4 - Claim your subdomain

To finish the procedure, make a pull request in our [GitHub repository][repo]
that adds your subdomain to the list of existing mod.land domains. Your new URL
should go live within 24 hours (keep an eye on your pull request in case of a
naming conflict or a question from our side).

```diff
import { CNAMEs } from "./mod/types.ts";

export default <CNAMEs> {
  "@": {
    target: "denosaurs.github.io/mod.land",
  },
+ "foo": {
+   target: "foo.github.io/bar",
+ }
};
```

## For advanced users

Our subdomain are _CNAME_ records which map one domain name to another. You can
actually point your mod.land to many different services like [Vercel][vercel] or
[Netlify][netlify].

## Important

As the owner of the repository, you keep complete control over your published
content. That also means that all rights and duties that come along with
publishing a GitHub Page (e.g. GDPR) remain in your responsibility.

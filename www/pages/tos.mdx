## § 1 Principles

**mod.land** is a free service provided by the owner of **mod.land** as stated in the imprint. The service will be only called
"**mod.land**". All services are incumbent upon these terms and conditions.

**mod.land** accompanies and extends the service "GitHub Pages" provided by GitHub, Inc ("GitHub"). **mod.land** provides free
subdomains underneath the domain "**mod.land**" to be used as a custom URL for a GitHub Page.

The Terms of the GitHub service and all rights of GitHub, Inc remain unaffected by the terms of **mod.land**.

Communication between **mod.land** and the user will take place on GitHub in the form of issues, pull requests or comments.

By submitting a pull request in the GitHub repo that accompanies and hosts **mod.land** with the wish to add a record to
the list of domains, the user attends the **mod.land** service and accepts the terms and conditions as the sole basis
of all services provided by **mod.land**.

## § 2 Availability and reservations
**mod.land** aims to ensure the constant availability of the subdomain service. A right on constant availability does not exist.

All services in connection with this free service will be provided on a voluntary basis. The user acquires no ownership
or other rights to single services, the registered subdomains and the whole service.

If the user violates the terms, **mod.land** is entitled to exclude the user from the service without notice subjected to damages
and other claims. **mod.land** is entitled to terminate or modify the service at any time without notice and without explanation.

In that case the user of **mod.land** will be informed timely, at least 7 days in advance by **mod.land**. The relevant information
about the impending use and deletion is shown simultaneously to the concerned users.

## § 3 Termination

Both sides can terminate at any time without stating any reasons.

The user cancels the service by removing the CNAME file in their repository and making a pull request in the repository
of **mod.land** with the wish to remove their subdomain from the list of active **mod.land** domains.

**mod.land** may also terminate the provision of a certain or all subdomains. Concerned users will be notified at least
7 days in advance by an issue in their GitHub repository

## § 4 Rights and Duties of the user
A transfer of a GitHub Page together with its **mod.land** subdomain is allowed as long as the new users accepts these terms
and conditions, in particular [§ 2][2] of the terms (no property right). The user receives a non-exclusive right from
**mod.land** to use the service. The use permit expires with cancellation of the conctractual agreement.

The user is fully responsible for the content provided by its GitHub Page, and is also responsible to extricate **mod.land**
from all third party claims. The user warrants not to transmit any material that violates the rights of others or
violates statutory provisions.

In particular providing content like the following is prohibited:

Piracy (warez, videos, MP3s, DVDs, software, etc.)
Phishing, scam, malware, viruses
Copyright offense
Dubious business models (eg, pyramid schemes, chain letters, etc.)
Content that is unlawful, obscene, threatening, abusive, libelous, or scandalous
Content which led to committing criminal acts or acts that undermine the civil order, or otherwise contrary to national
or international laws
Pornography or content intended for adults only
Unsecured Web 2.0 platforms (eg. no captcha protection in forums, blogs, guest books)

Sites with other illegal content

A violation of these rules will result in immediate deletion of the **mod.land** domain.

The user is obliged to publish legals on his website which contains at least the full name, mailing address and an e-mail
adress.

## § 5 Limitation of Liability

In principle **mod.land** takes no responsability for the support. The use of the provided services of **mod.land** takes place
at your own risk. This refers in particular to the functionality, availability and freedom from viruses of the
provided services as well as damage caused by the use of programs, program components and scripts/applets. The
user is obliged to create local copies of all his data at **mod.land** for security reasons and regularly to secure
all stored data. **mod.land** indicates that **mod.land** is a free service and does not create data backups for the users.

The user is liable for any use of the service performed by his GitHub user account. Legal representatives are liable
for minors. The user therefore has to ensure that his access can not be misused by third parties.

**mod.land** provides the service without any express or implied warranties. **mod.land** is not liable for inadvertent disclosure,
damage or loss of transmitted, received or stored data from **mod.land**. The user expressly acknowledges that these
terms also effect third party supplies.

For the purposed service usage as described above **mod.land** solely assume the liability for the injury to life, limb
and health, and other damages caused by gross neglect of duty on **mod.land**
A liability of **mod.land** for slight negligence exists only for breach of an essential contractual obligation
A liability of **mod.land** for further damages, in particular consequential damages, indirect damages or lost profits
is excluded.

A liability for malfunctions or failure as well as unauthorized access from outside the sphere of influence of **mod.land**
is only in the context of intent and gross negligence.

## § 6 Name of the subdomain
Each user can select the names of subdomains in accordance to the URL provided by the GitHub Pages service and with respect
to a public available list of restricted names published in the **mod.land** repository. It is sole responsibility of the
user to consider whether the name is contrary to statutory provisions, third party rights (including trade marks
or registered rights), or morality. If this is the case, the registration of the subdomain is to be omitted. The
same applies to subdomains, whose name is misleading, or suspect websites which are excluded of the participation
in the service because of their content according to [§ 4][4].

## § 7 Absolute ban of spam
References to domains registered at **mod.land** in unsolicited commercial e-mail or similar media (spam) are not allowed.

The mass registering of domains for the purpose of irritation to the users of search engines are also considered
spam and are also inadmissible.

## § 8 Manipulation
It is prohibited to auto retrieve masses of **mod.land** subdomains.

## § 9 Responsibility
**mod.land** is not responsible for the names of subdomains or the content of external websites that are registered as link
destinations of subdomains, or otherwise linked to this service.

## § 10 Change of Terms
**mod.land** reserves the right to make changes to the Terms of Service. The user will be informed by **mod.land** of the changes
through a notice in the readme section of the **mod.land** repository.
